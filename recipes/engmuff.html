    <h3>Get dem buns warm and toasty</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now that I drove everyone away with that title, we can focus on some <em>buns</em> </p>
    <p>I adapted this for euros because well...corn is a USA thing</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>450g flour</li>
        <li>packet of yeast(17g)</li>
        <li>125 ml whole milk</li>
        <li>125 ml of warm water</li>
        <li>Tbsp of sugar</li>
        <li>Tsp of salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine millk, water and yeast, mix it up and leave it for 15 mins</li>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar and salt</li>
        <li>Combine the liquids and the solids and knead 'em</em></li>
        <li>I SAID KNEAD 'EM</li>
        <li>When it goes from hetero to homo, you let that thing rest for an hour</li>
        <li>After the hour is up, you take that big ball of dough, deflate it and roll it <em>thicc</em></li>
        <li>Not too thick, like the thickness of your thumb thick, if you have the mits of a sailor, use a ruler or your appendage</li>
        <li>After rolling it out, take a cup, cut them circles out, lightly cover them with some bread crumbs if you have any, or don't, not that big of a deal</li>
        <li>Put the things on a skillet, and on a medium temp toast them. At the same time, heat up the oven to 90Â°C and after toasting just toss them in</li>
        <li>After the last one is done toasting, leave them in for another 10 minutes and then turn off the heat and put them on a rack to cool down</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now put it all on a tray and serve with some jam, bakalar, whatever, it's bread for christsake's</p>
