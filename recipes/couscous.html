    <h3>A nourishing meal that you can whip up when you just don't feel like it</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>This salad is a personal favorite of mine, when I need something quick, tasty and filling.</p>
    <p>You can tweak this dish very easily to your preferences and have it ready to go in minutes.</p>
    <p>For my version, I'm gonna put a bit of a Balkan/Greek <em>twist</em> to it, since I am from that part of the world.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A cup of couscous</li>
        <li>Chicken bouillion or stock</li>
